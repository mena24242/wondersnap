# WonderSnap

**Gesture-controlled 3D models made of glowing light particles, running entirely in your browser.**
**English + العربية** — the whole UI, the voice commands and the read-aloud work in both languages.

Snap your fingers in front of your webcam and up to 250,000 GPU particles swirl into existence. Make a fist and they
form the Eiffel Tower, a beating heart or a V8 engine. Open your hand and the model morphs into the next one, or
explodes into a labelled diagram of every part. No mouse, no controller, no install beyond Node.js.

## Quick start

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer and a webcam (optional: everything also works with the mouse and
keyboard).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkbarSheikh-debug/wondersnap.git
cd wondersnap
npm install
npm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in Chrome or Edge and click **Start with camera**, or **Continue without camera**
to drive it with the on-screen buttons and keyboard.

> The browser only allows camera access on `localhost` or `https`, which is why the app comes with its own tiny
> local server. To use a different port: `npm start -- 8080`.

## How it works

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Hand tracking** | [MediaPipe Hand Landmarker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker) tracks up to two hands (21 landmarks each) from the webcam, fully on-device |
| **Gesture recognition** | Custom classifiers turn landmarks into poses (fist, open, point, pinch, peace), a finger-snap detector, hand twist/tilt and two-hand zoom, fed through a debouncer and a state machine |
| **Particle engine** | A hand-written WebGL2 renderer. Particle physics runs on the GPU with transform feedback: no Three.js, no game engine, no framework |
| **Models** | 33 procedural models built from real measurements and sampled into point clouds, with named parts that can explode, glow and be pulled out |
| **Server** | A zero-dependency Node.js static server (`server.mjs`) |

Nothing is sent anywhere: the video never leaves your machine.

## Gestures

| Gesture | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🫰 **Snap** | Summon the particles, or dissolve the current model |
| ✊ **Fist** | Form the wonder, organ or machine |
| ✋ **Open hand** | Wonders morph to the next one. Organs, engines and vehicles **explode**: how far you open your hand sets how far the parts fly apart, and closing it puts them back together |
| 🔄 **Twist / raise your hand** | Turn and tilt the formed model |
| ☝️ **Point** | Hold your finger on a part to select it. It glows, and a card explains what it does |
| 🤏 **Pinch** | Pull the selected part out toward you; pinch again to put it back |
| 🙌 **Two hands** | Move them apart or together to zoom |
| ✌️ **Peace** | Jump to the next model |

## Keyboard and mouse

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` | Snap |
| `F` / `O` / `V` | Fist / open hand / peace sign |
| `←` `→` | Previous / next model |
| `E`, `↑` `↓`, mouse wheel | Explode amount |
| `+` `-` `0`, ctrl + wheel | Zoom |
| `C` | Camera on/off |
| `L` | Part labels |
| `R` | Auto-rotate |
| `G` | Hand rotation on/off |
| `X` | Cut-away cross-section (`,` and `.` nudge the plane) |
| `Q` | Quiz mode |
| `M` | Voice commands and read-aloud |
| `S` | Sound effects (heartbeat, snap, explosions) |
| `K` | Record a video |
| `D` | Play the demo |
| `I` / `Esc` | Describe / deselect the selected part |
| `H` | Help |

Click a part to select it, drag to rotate.

## Features

- **Beating heart and breathing lungs.** The heart contracts in a lub-dub rhythm at 72 bpm, the lungs inflate every
  4.5 s, and pulses of light travel through them like blood or air.
- **Exploded views with named parts.** Every part has a leader-line label saying what it does.
- **Quiz mode.** "Find: Hippocampus": point at (or click) the right part. Five questions, with a score.
- **Voice control.** Say "show me the heart", "open it up", "where is the right atrium", "zoom in", "quiz" and more.
  Parts are read aloud with speech synthesis (Chrome or Edge).
- **Cut-away.** A cutting plane follows your hand and reveals a glowing cross-section.
- **Recording.** Save a WebM video of the scene.
- **Arabic (العربية).** Click 🌐 (or add `?lang=ar`): the UI flips to RTL Arabic, model names and facts are
  translated, parts are read aloud in Arabic, and the voice commands understand Arabic — «أرني القلب»، «فكّكه»،
  «التالي»، «اختبرني».
- **Sound effects.** Press `S` or click 🔊: a synthesized heartbeat in phase with the visual pulse, snap /
  form / dissolve effects and quiz feedback — all Web Audio, no audio files.
- **Auto quality.** When the frame rate drops, the render scale is lowered step by step (and restored when
  it recovers), so the app stays smooth on slower GPUs. Turn it off in ⚙ Settings or with `?autoq=0`.
- **Settings panel.** ⚙ — language, particle count, sound, auto quality and trails, persisted across visits.
- **Installable / offline (PWA).** A service worker caches everything after the first visit (network-first,
  so updates are never stale), and the app can be installed from the browser.

## Deploying online

`node build.mjs` produces a self-contained static bundle in `dist/` (the MediaPipe runtime is vendored out of
`node_modules`), ready for any static host. A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) deploys it
to **GitHub Pages** on every push to `main` — one-time setup: repository *Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions*.

## Tests

37 end-to-end and unit tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), driving the real app with synthetic hands on
a deterministic clock. They run automatically on every push via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

```bash
npx playwright install chromium   # one time
npm test
```

| Spec | Covers |
|---|---|
| `app.spec.js` | The full gesture story, every model, explode/contract, keyboard, wheel, tabs, demo, phone layout, hand twist and tilt |
| `features.spec.js` | Heartbeat and breathing, two-hand zoom, point-to-pick, pinch-to-pull, quiz, voice commands, cut-away, video recording |
| `camera.spec.js` | Real `getUserMedia` to MediaPipe on Chromium's fake webcam, plus the camera-denied fallback |
| `gpu.spec.js` | The GPU physics shader matches its CPU twin to ~1e-7 in every mode |
| `logic.spec.js` | Pose classifiers, snap detector, debouncer, state machine, controller, voice-command parser (English + Arabic) |
| `models.spec.js` | Every model is deterministic, finite and fast, with real measurements and correctly exploding parts |

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera doesn't start:** open the app via `http://localhost:5173`, not by double-clicking `index.html`, and allow
  camera access when the browser asks.
- **Hand tracking never loads:** run `npm install` first; the tracking runtime is served from `node_modules`.
- **Low frame rate:** try `http://localhost:5173/?n=100000&dpr=1`.
- **Port already in use:** `npm start -- 8080` and open `http://localhost:8080`.
